* Requirements to run this program:
  * -Python 2.7
  * -Pygame 1.9.6

After pygame is installed, run the command:

```
python2 main.py
```

To exit the game click the exit button. Otherwise, when the user collects all the trash the winner screen appears. The winner screen will appear for 5 seconds then go to the start screen again.

## Reason for the game
This was supposed to be a simple python project for an intro to programming class. For example, most people did things along the lines of read in text from the user and manipulate it in some way or they set up simple multiple choice question games. Seeing that I had more experience than most likely everyone in the course I wanted to push myself to try something I had never done before. So, I found the pygame library and started to teach myself how to use it. After a few weeks of learning and tweaking I managed to walk away with a simple game that could easily be extended and advanced if I ever felt like it.
