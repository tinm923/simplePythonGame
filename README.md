## Reason for the game
The earth is the home to everyone no matter their race, religion, creed, or sexual orientation. With that being said, it is our job to protect it. We need to unite and make the earth cleaner so it does not wither away. That way we will all be able to fufill our lives and provide a better place for the generations to come. This game is just a reminder that it only takes a few seconds to pick up some trash or recycle materials.
